## Running Locally

This instructions are using `pnpm` as package manager but you can choose any other (`npm`, `yarn`, `bun`).

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
    pnpm install 
```

You have to configure your local environment variables in the `.env` file. Look at the [.env.example](/.env.example) file.

Once configured, run the development server:

```bash
    pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
